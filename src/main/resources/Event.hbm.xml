        <!--inverse: it means which side is responsible to take care of the relationship.
        In Hibernate, only the “relationship owner” should maintain the relationship, and
         the “inverse” keyword is created to defines which side is the owner to maintain the relationship.
         In short, inverse=”true” means this is the relationship owner, and inverse=”false” (default) means it’s not.

         all bi-directional associations need one side as inverse. In a one-to-many association it has to be
          the many-side, and in many-to-many association you can select either side.
